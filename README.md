# Lightweight Crash Log Framework

The Lightweight Crash Log Framework is a reference implementation designed for
decoding and extracting data using Intel® Crash Log Technology. It can function
as a standalone application or be integrated into other applications.

>[!WARNING] 
> This tool is in the early stages of development and does not yet support all
> platforms utilizing Crash Log technology. However, it can decode the common
> header structure on unsupported platforms. We are actively working to expand
> platform support. Additionally, the set of registers collected may vary
> between projects.

## What is Intel® Crash Log Technology?

Intel® Crash Log Technology is a mechanism for collecting debug information
from the System-on-Chip (SoC), such as status/error registers and state
machines, and storing it in on-die memory. Data collection is triggered by
unrecoverable system errors, like fatal machine check exceptions or unexpected
resets.

When valid records are present in the SoC during boot, the BIOS copies them
into the ACPI Boot Error Record Table (BERT) to expose them to the OS. The data
stored in the BERT can then be accessed via Windows Event Logs, Linux sysfs, or
the EFI shell.

## Features Overview

- Extract Intel Crash Log records from Windows Event Logs, Linux sysfs, and the
  EFI shell.
- Decode Intel Crash Log records and export the content as JSON.

## Repository Structure

- **[Library](lib/):** A library for extracting and decoding Crash Log records.
- **[Collateral Tree](lib/collateral):** A collection of product-specific
  collateral needed for decoding Crash Log records.
- **[Command Line Tool](app/):** A standalone application for extracting and
  decoding Crash Log records.
- **[EFI Tool](efi/):** An EFI tool for reading Crash Log records stored in
  ACPI tables from the EFI shell.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Install the Rust Toolchain**

   Before building the project, install the Rust toolchain using
   [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

> [!NOTE]
> The nightly toolchain is required to build this project. Install it with:
> `rustup default nightly`

2. **Install the CLI Application**

  Run the following command to install the CLI application:

  ```
  $ cargo install --path app/
  ```

3. **Uninstall the CLI Application**

  To uninstall the CLI application, use:

  ```
  $ cargo uninstall -p intel_crashlog_app
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> - For building and using the EFI application, refer to
>   [this document](efi/README.md).
> - To use this reference code in your own application, refer to
>   [this document](lib/README.md).

### Usage

- **Extract** the Crash Log from the Windows Event Log or Linux sysfs:

```
$ iclg extract sample.crashlog
```

- **List** all the collected records:

```
$ iclg info sample.crashlog
  #   Record Type      Product  Size    Skt  Die
----- ---------------- -------- ------- ---- ---------
 0-0  MCA              XYZ/all     832     0
 1-0  CRASHLOG_AGENT   XYZ/all      40     0 io0
```

- **Export** the Crash Log content into JSON:

```
$ iclg decode sample.crashlog
{
    "crashlog_data": {
        ...
    }
}
```

- List available commands using the `--help` option:

```
$ iclg --help
Extract and decode Intel Crash Log records.

Usage: iclg [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  extract  Extract the Crash Log records from the platform
  decode   Decode Crash Log records into JSON
  info     List the Crash Log records stored in the input file
  unpack   Unpack the Crash Log records stored in the input file
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --collateral-tree <dir>  Path to the collateral tree. If not specified, the builtin collateral tree will be used
  -v, --verbose...             Sets the verbosity of the logging messages. -v: Warning, -vv: Info, -vvv: Debug, -vvvv: Trace
  -h, --help                   Print help
```
